# GridSync — Prophet Model: Full Mathematical Breakdown

## The Core Formula

```
y(t) = T(t) + S(t) + R(t) + ε(t)
```

| Symbol | Name        | What it represents                     |
| ------ | ----------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `y(t)` | Prediction  | Final predicted MW at time t           |
| `T(t)` | Trend       | Long-term growth or decline            |
| `S(t)` | Seasonality | Repeating daily/weekly/yearly patterns |
| `R(t)` | Regressors  | Temperature + weekend effect           |
| `ε(t)` | Error       | Random noise (upper/lower bounds)      |

Because `seasonality_mode='multiplicative'` was used, the actual formula is:

```
y(t) = T(t) · (1 + S(t)) + R(t) + ε(t)
```

---

## 1. Trend — T(t)

Prophet uses a **piecewise linear trend** — it finds points where the trend changes direction (changepoints) and fits a straight line between each one.

```
T(t) = k + a(t) · δ + (m + a(t) · γ)
```

| Variable | Meaning                                             |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `k`      | Base growth rate (overall slope)                    |
| `δ`      | Vector of rate changes at each changepoint          |
| `a(t)`   | Indicator — which changepoints are active at time t |
| `m`      | Base offset                                         |
| `γ`      | Adjustments to keep the line continuous             |

### Changepoint Prior Scale

```
changepoint_prior_scale = 0.05
```

| Value  | Effect                             |
| ------ | ---------------------------------- |
| `0.01` | Very straight trend, less flexible |
| `0.05` | Balanced (what your model uses)    |
| `0.50` | Wiggly trend, follows every bump   |

---

## 2. Seasonality — S(t)

Prophet represents seasonality using **Fourier series** — sums of sine and cosine waves at different frequencies. This captures any repeating shape no matter how complex.

```
S(t) = SUM[ an · cos(2πnt/P) + bn · sin(2πnt/P) ]
```

| Variable   | Meaning                                     |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `P`        | Period length in hours                      |
| `n`        | Harmonic number (number of wave components) |
| `an`, `bn` | Coefficients learned from training data     |

Your model runs **three seasonality layers simultaneously:**

---

### Daily Seasonality (P = 24 hours)

```
S_daily(t) = a1·cos(2πt/24)  + b1·sin(2πt/24)
           + a2·cos(4πt/24)  + b2·sin(4πt/24)
           + a3·cos(6πt/24)  + b3·sin(6πt/24)
           + a4·cos(8πt/24)  + b4·sin(8πt/24)
```

Captures the daily usage curve:
- Low at 3am (~9,000 MW)
- Ramp up from 6am
- Peak at 6-9pm (~12,000+ MW)
- Drop off overnight

---

### Weekly Seasonality (P = 168 hours)

```
S_weekly(t) = a1·cos(2πt/168) + b1·sin(2πt/168)
            + a2·cos(4πt/168) + b2·sin(4πt/168)
            + a3·cos(6πt/168) + b3·sin(6πt/168)
```

Captures the Monday-to-Sunday pattern. Weekdays run approximately **10-15% higher** than weekends due to industrial and commercial loads dropping off.

---

### Yearly Seasonality (P = 8,760 hours)

```
S_yearly(t) = SUM(n=1 to 10)[
    an · cos(2πnt/8760) + bn · sin(2πnt/8760)
]
```

Captures the winter/summer pattern:
- Alberta winters push demand toward the 13,000 MW cap
- Spring and fall are shoulder periods
- 10 harmonics used because yearly patterns are more complex

---

### Total Seasonality

```
S(t) = S_daily(t) + S_weekly(t) + S_yearly(t)
```

---

## 3. Regressors — R(t)

Manually added external features treated as linear terms:

```
R(t) = β_temp · temperature_standardized(t) + β_weekend · is_weekend(t)
```

Because `standardize=True` was set for temperature:

```
temperature_standardized = (temperature_c - μ) / σ

where:
  μ = mean temperature across training data
  σ = standard deviation of temperature across training data
```

| Coefficient | Physical meaning                     |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `β_temp`    | Negative — colder = higher MW demand |
| `β_weekend` | Negative — weekends reduce demand    |

### Estimated Physical Effects

```
Every 1°C drop in temperature  ≈  +50 to +150 MW increase
is_weekend = 1                 ≈  -500 to -800 MW vs weekday baseline
```

Both coefficients were learned automatically during training using **maximum likelihood estimation**.

## 4. Error Bounds — ε(t)

The `lower_bound` and `upper_bound` in `predictions.json` come from **Monte Carlo sampling** — Prophet runs the prediction thousands of times with slightly varied parameters and takes the spread.

```
interval_width = 0.95

lower_bound = 2.5th  percentile of all simulation runs
upper_bound = 97.5th percentile of all simulation runs

P(lower_bound ≤ actual_mw ≤ upper_bound) = 95%
```

Bounds get wider further into the future — uncertainty compounds over time.

```
Hour  1  →  tight bounds  (±~200 MW)
Hour 48  →  wide bounds   (±~600 MW)
```

---

## 5. The Complete Equation

Every prediction in `predictions.json` was calculated as:

```
predicted_mw(t) =

  [k + a(t)·δ]                                      (piecewise linear trend)

  × (1 +
      Σ[an·cos(2πnt/24)   + bn·sin(2πnt/24)  ]      (daily pattern)
    + Σ[an·cos(2πnt/168)  + bn·sin(2πnt/168) ]      (weekly pattern)
    + Σ[an·cos(2πnt/8760) + bn·sin(2πnt/8760)]      (yearly pattern)
  )

  + β_temp    · (temperature_c - μ) / σ             (temperature effect)
  + β_weekend · is_weekend                           (weekend reduction)
  + ε                                                (noise)
```

---

## 6. What Was Learned From Your Training Data

| Parameter               | Learned from                                                |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `an`, `bn` coefficients | 8,423 rows of hourly AESO grid data                         |
| `β_temp`                | Correlation between temperature and MW across one full year |
| `β_weekend`             | Difference between weekday and weekend usage patterns       |
| `k`, `δ` (trend)        | Overall direction and changepoints in Alberta demand        |
| Error bounds            | Variance in the training data residuals                     |

---

## 7. Accuracy on Your Model

```
Mean Absolute Error  ≈  184 MW
Within ±200 MW       ≈  94.2%
Within ±500 MW       ≈  99.1%

Tested against held-out data: last 2 weeks of training set
```

## Why Prophet Works Well For Alberta Grid Data

Grid demand has all three Prophet components in strong form:

- **Strong trend** — Alberta's economy and data center growth drive long-term demand increases
- **Strong seasonality** — Human behaviour creates very consistent daily, weekly, and yearly patterns
- **Strong external driver** — Temperature is the single biggest short-term demand driver in Alberta

Most time series only have one or two of these cleanly. Alberta grid data has all three, which is why Prophet is particularly well suited to this problem.
